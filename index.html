    <span><h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Andrea's portfolio. So nice of you to stop by! Here you can see what I've achieved so far at Hyper,
    who I am and how to contact me.</p></span>

    <h2 id="me">Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a dog and code loving student at Hyper Island Stockholm. I study the Digital Data Strategist program,
    where I've learned about: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEM, SEO, Google Analytics, AdWords and a lot about team work and how to handle data.
    My goal after Hyper is to work as a front end developer, perhaps dabbling in SEM, escpecially in SEO.</p>

    <p>Before coming to Hyper, I worked as a freelance journalist at Oh My! and OP communication, where I've written many articles and interviewed
    a bunch of people. I also have a bachelor's degree in English linguistics from the Professional Language program at Stockholm University, where
    I studied English and Swedish linguistics with a focus on business communication.<p>

    <p>As a person, I am happy, organized, calm and I love all sorts of games (pc, video, boardgame, you name it).
    I also love dogs, creating things (everything from web sites to scarfs), languages and reading.</p>

    <h2 id="projects">Hyper Projects</h2>
    <p>Before Hyper, I had no experience of coding. During our first 7 week module (course), Data Landscape, I learned so much,
      and when it was over, I realised how much I loved it. The languages I was introduced to were HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Here are some of the sites I've made so far:</p>

    <p>https://andreamogren.github.io/weektwo/
      This was the second page I ever made, during my second week of coding. The assignment was to find some sorts of
      data that you thought was interesting and then visualize it through graphs.
      We were also supposed to make it available online.
      To make these graphs, I used chart.js. It was quite challenging, seeing as I
      knew no JavaScript at all at this point. But I made it work anyway!</p>

      <p>https://andreamogren.github.io/apichallenge/
      I made this site together with a classmate. This week, the challenge was to use and API.
      We found a Star Wars API (my partner was a massive fan) and somehow got it to work. I think
      it was a very useful experience, since I understood nothing from the beginning and thought it was going
      to be impossible to make it work, but we still did it! It's case sensitive though, but you can't have it all...</p>

      <p>http://adventuring.se/categories/far-away.html
      The final assignment of Data Landscape was to make a site offering some kind of service that incorporated everything
      we'd learned so far. My group and I created Adventuring, a site where you can generate a random adventure to go on
      somehwere in Stockholm. This is where I learned a lot of the JavaScript I know now. We used the Google directions API,
      created our own Json file with different locations, and a script where you input your location and then get a random location.
      We also made it so that you can choose a category, to make sure that you get an adventure that suits your needs.</p>

      <p>http://internisland.io/
      This is the most recent site that I've made. I made it together with my group during the Organic growth
      course. It's a site that feature Hyper Island graduates their internship stories and advice. The site
      itself was made through Jekyll, which I hadn't used before. The objective of the course was to learn about
      SEO and to launch something that would be useful to us and others.</p>

      <p>Looking back, I feel that I've made a lot of progress during my first time here at Hyper, and I've made sure to
      keep coding in my free time, so that I can keep learning even more.
      Right now, I am reading <a id="bookLink" href="http://www.javascriptbook.com/">this book.</a>
      I am also planning to learn how to use node.js and how to animate with CSS soon.</p>

    <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
    <p> If you want to reach out to me, feel free to do so! I look forward to hearing from you and
      will answer as quickly as I can :) </p>
