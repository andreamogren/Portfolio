    <h1>Hi Tretton37!</h1>

    <p id="tretton37">Here is the secret page I've made for your eyes only, to show why I think I would
    fit in with you. I hope you that you feel honored!</p>

    <h1>Craftsmanship as a lifestyle</h1>
    <p>From previous coworkers and current fellow Hyper students, I often hear that I am very driven and ambitious.
    I really like being presented with a problem, burying myself in it and figuring out the best way to solve it.
    I am very stubborn and dedicated, and also good at planning how to solve said problem, no matter if it's to learn a
    specific course goal or figuring out why CSS rules don't work.</p>

    <h1>What you see is who we are</h1>
    <p>At Hyper, I've practiced my ability to be more open and straight forward. I feel that I
    have developed a lot during my time and that it is a lot easier for me to be honest
    when I disagree and to work with others when they need something different from the rest
    of the group. I am realistic about the amount of work I can take on, and will be honest
    and say no if I already have much to do, or if something is to difficult for me.</p>

    <h1>Challenge the world</h1>
    <p>I feel most motivated when I work on something that solves a real problem for someone, something
    that is actually useful for others. For example, the adventuring.se project (see "Projects" tab), which can give
    people who are new to Stockholm the chance to explore the city. I have always loved learning, and constantly
    strive to learn new things.</p>

    <h1>Embrace the family spirit</h1>
    <p>I always do my best to make sure that everyone feels included in groups, and I try to see things
    from other people's perspectives instead of being upset with them for not agreeing with me. I have
    been told that I am a good listener, and in the groups where I have been the leader I have got feedback
    stating that I am good at making people feel good in a group and that I am good at showing appreciation.</p>

    <h1>Have fun</h1>
    <p>Even though I am very dedicated and hard working, I still believe that balance is important.
    Having fun together I think makes for being more motivated to work together. At Hyper, I try to do
    my best to help my class mates feel motivated and happy, from asking if there is something I can do for people who are unmotivated to
    bringing popcorn. I feel that if you only focus on work, you will not be motivated to work after a while.</p>
