    <h1 id="me">Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I am a code loving student at Hyper Island Stockholm. I study the Digital Data Strategist program,
    where I've learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SEM, SEO, Google Analytics, AdWords and a lot about team work and how to handle data.
    My goal after Hyper is to work as a front end developer, perhaps dabbling in SEM, especially in SEO. I have hardcoded this site as a way
    to challenge myself. I aim to have it develop as I do!</p>

    <p>Before coming to Hyper, I worked as a freelance journalist at Oh My! and OP communication, where I've written many articles and interviewed
    a bunch of people. I also have a bachelor's degree in English linguistics from the Professional Language program at Stockholm University, where
    I studied English and Swedish linguistics with a focus on business communication.<p>

    <p>As a person, I am happy, organized, calm and I love all sorts of games (pc, video, boardgame, you name it).
    I also love dogs, creating things (everything from web sites to scarfs), languages and reading.</p>
